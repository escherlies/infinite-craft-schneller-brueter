# Infinite-Craft Schneller Br√ºter

This automatically crafts https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/ items.

My favorite crafts:
```
Stone ü™® + Fjord üèûÔ∏è = Troll üëπ
Lily üå∏ + Fjord üèûÔ∏è = Nymph üßö
Lily üå∏ + Seaweed üåä = Mermaid üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Engine üöó + Pollen üå± = Bee üêù
```

Data provided here are the crafts up to the 3rd generation :) For example: 
- [3rd Generation Items](./data_hr/gen3_items.txt)
- [3rd Generation Crafts](./data_hr/gen3_crafts.txt)


There are two folders: [data](./data) for processing, and [data_hr](./data_hr) for human readable format

1. Thanks [Neal](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) for the craft game.
2. Thanks [Pinpox](https://github.com/pinpox) for showing me this game and then wasting 1h of my life and then wasting another hour because everything should be open source, right?
